# Portfolio 1.0

## My First Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋  
This is the **very first portfolio website**🎓 I created while I was pursuing my degree in **Final Year**. I recently found the files and realized I had never uploaded or deployed it back then — so here it is, finally on GitHub! 😊

## 📌 About the Project

This portfolio was a personal project I made to showcase my early projects, skills, and a bit about myself during my college days. It was my first step toward building an online presence and trying out web development.

Even though it's a simple design, it holds a lot of memories and marks the beginning of my learning journey in tech.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (basic)

## 🧠 What I Learned

At the time of building this portfolio, I learned:
- How to structure a webpage using HTML
- Styling and responsiveness with CSS
- Basic interactivity using JavaScript
- Organizing a simple project folder

 ## 🚀 Future Plans

While this version will remain as-is (as a reminder of where I started), I’ve been working on a more advanced and modern portfolio with better design, performance, and features — stay tuned for that!😉
